    <h1>What is XML?</h1>

    
     <li>XML stands for EXtensible Markup Languaje</li>

    <li>XML is a markup languaje much like HTML</li>

    <li>XML was designed to describe data</li>

    <li>XML tags are not predefined. You must define your own tags</li>

    <li>XML uses a Document Type Definition(DTD) or an XML Schema to describe the data</li>

    <li>XML with a DTD or XML Schema is designed to be self-descriptive</li>

    <h2>The main difference between XML and HTML</h2>

    <p>XML was designed to carry data.</p>

    <p>XML is not a replacement for HTML</p>

    <p>XML and HTML were designed with different goals:</p>

    <p>XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is.</p>

    <p>HTML was designed to display data and to focus on how data looks.</p>

    <p>HTML is about displaying information, while XMLS is about describing information.</p>

    <h3>XML does not Do anything</h3>

    <p>Maybe it is a little hard to understan, but XML does not DO anything. XML was created to structure, store and to send information.</p>

    <p>The following example is a note to Tove from Jani, stored as XML: </p>

    <img src="../Recursos/imagen1.jfif" alt="">

    <p>The note has a header and a message body. It also has sender and receiver information. But still, this XML document does <br> not DO anything. It is just pure information wrapped in XML tags. Someoe must write a piece of software to send, receive or display it.</p>
